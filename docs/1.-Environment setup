=Environment setup=

We need a base from which to design and make our kernel. Here I will
be assuming that you are using a *nix system, with the GNU
toolchain. If you want to use a windows system, you must either use
cygwin (which is a *nix emulation environment) or DJGPP. Either way,
the makefiles and commands in this tutorial may not work.

==Directory structure==

My directory is laid out as follows:

 tutorial
  |
  +-- src
  |
  +-- docs

All your source files will go in src, and all your documentation (you
do write documentation? ;) ) should go in docs.

==Compiling==

The examples in this tutorial should compile successfully with the GNU
toolchain (gcc, ld, gas, etc). The assembly examples are written in
intel syntax, which is (my personal opinion) a much more
human-readable syntax than the AT&T syntax that GNU AS uses. To
assemble these, you will need the [[Netwide Assembler|http://nasm.sourceforge.net]].

This tutorial is ''not'' a bootloader tutorial. We will be using
[[GRUB|http://www.gnu.org/software/grub]] to load our kernel. To do this, we
need a floppy disk image with GRUB preloaded onto it. There are
[[tutorials]] to do this, but, happily, I have made a standard image,
which can be found [[here]]. This goes in your 'tutorial' (or whatever
you named it) directory.

==Running==

There is no alternative for bare hardware as a testbed
system. Unfortunately, bare hardware is pretty pants at telling you
where things went wrong (but of course, you're going to write
completely bug-free code first time, aren't you?). Enter
[[Bochs|http://www.bochs.sourceforge.net]]. Bochs is an open-source x86-64
emulator. When things go completely awry, bochs will tell you, and
store the processor state in a logfile, which is extremely
useful. Also it can be run and rebooted much faster than a real
machine. My examples will be made to run well on bochs.

==Bochs==

In order to run bochs, you are going to need a bochs configuration
file (bochsrc.txt). Coincidentally, a sample one is included below!

Take care with the locations of the bios files. These seem to change
between installations, and if you made bochs from source it is very
likely you don't even have them. Google their filenames, you can get
them from the official bochs site among others.

 megs: 32
 romimage: file=/usr/share/bochs/BIOS-bochs-latest, address=0xf0000
 vgaromimage: /usr/share/bochs/VGABIOS-elpin-2.40
 floppya: 1_44=/dev/loop0, status=inserted
 boot: a
 log: bochsout.txt
 mouse: enabled=0
 clock: sync=realtime
 cpu: ips=500000

This will make bochs emulate a 32MB machine with a clock speed similar
to a 350MHz PentiumII. The instructions per second can be cranked up -
I prefer a slower emulation speed, simply so I can see what is going
on if lots of text is being scrolled.

==Useful scripts==

We are going to be doing several things very often - making (compiling
and linking) our project, and transferring the resulting kernel binary
to our floppy disk image.

===Makefile===

  Make
 # Makefile for JamesM's kernel tutorials.
 # The C and C++ rules are already setup by default.
 # The only one that needs changing is the assembler 
 # rule, as we use nasm instead of GNU as.
 
 SOURCES=boot.o
 
 CFLAGS=
 LDFLAGS=-Tlink.ld
 ASFLAGS=-felf
 
 all: $(SOURCES) link 
 
 clean:
 	-rm *.o kernel
 
 link:
 	ld $(LDFLAGS) -o kernel $(SOURCES)
 
 .s.o:
 	nasm $(ASFLAGS) $<

This Makefile will compile every file in SOURCES, then link them
together into one ELF binary, 'kernel'. It uses a linker script,
'link.ld' to do this:

===Link.ld===

 /* Link.ld -- Linker script for the kernel - ensure everything goes in the */
 /*            Correct place.  */
 /*            Original file taken from Bran's Kernel Development */
 /*            tutorials: http://www.osdever.net/bkerndev/index.php. */
 
 ENTRY(start)
 SECTIONS
 {
   .text 0x100000 :
   {
     code = .; _code = .; __code = .;
     *(.text)
     . = ALIGN(4096);
   }
 
   .data :
   {
      data = .; _data = .; __data = .;
      *(.data)
      *(.rodata)
      . = ALIGN(4096);
   }
 
   .bss :
   {
     bss = .; _bss = .; __bss = .;
     *(.bss)
     . = ALIGN(4096);
   }
 
   end = .; _end = .; __end = .;
 }

This script tells LD how to set up our kernel image. Firstly it tells
LD that the start location of our binary should be the symbol 'start'.
It then tells LD that the .text section (that's where all your code
goes) should be first, and should start at 0x100000 (1MB). The .data
(initialised static data) and the .bss (uninitialised static data)
should be next, and each should be page-aligned (ALIGN(4096)).
Linux GCC also adds in an extra data section: .rodata. This is for
read-only initialised data, such as constants. For simplicity we
simply bundle this in with the .data section.

===update_image.sh===

A nice little script that will poke your new kernel binary into the
floppy image file (This assumes you have made a directory /mnt). Note:
you will need /sbin in your $PATH to use losetup.

  Bash
 #!/bin/bash
 
 sudo losetup /dev/loop0 floppy.img
 sudo mount /dev/loop0 /mnt
 sudo cp src/kernel /mnt/kernel
 sudo umount /dev/loop0
 sudo losetup -d /dev/loop0

===run_bochs.sh===

This script will setup a loopback device, run bochs on it, then
disconnect it.

  Bash
 #!/bin/bash
 
 # run_bochs.sh
 # mounts the correct loopback device, runs bochs, then unmounts.
 
 sudo /sbin/losetup /dev/loop0 floppy.img
 sudo bochs -f bochsrc.txt
 sudo /sbin/losetup -d /dev/loop0
